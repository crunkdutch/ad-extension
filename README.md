## Instructions on how to run the project. 
* Install https://www.tampermonkey.net/
* Navigate to the Dashboard of the extension
* Click the + icon to create a new script
* Copy all the code from the `main.js` file into the new script
* Save the updates
* Load any of the websites listed in the assignment reqs

## A brief explanation of your implementation. 
* It is a very basic implementation with Vanilla JS, descriptive variables, methods, and overall execution
## Any assumptions or design decisions made. 
* I made a call to use Tampermonkey, because of the CSP limitations / pain to implement with creating custom chrome extensions. 
  * I didn't include an index.html, because with Tampermonkey, its also not needed!
